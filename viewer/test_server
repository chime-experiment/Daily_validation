# This script will help you set-up and run a test-deployment
# of the viewer on bao.
#
# It must be run from within a gunicorn-enabled virtualenv.
# You can use the production virtualenv
# (/opt/venvs/daily_viewer) without issue, or else roll
# your own.
#
# By default, this script will first set-up bao to run the
# test server from the current directory, and then start
# the server.  If you only want to run the install portion
# of the script, pass '-i' as an argument.
#
# If you have created a local "rendered" directory in the
# current directory, that will be used by the test server.
# If you haven't made one, a symlink will be made from the
# production `/rendered` directory into the current directory
# for use by the test server.  (You can remove this later and
# replace it with a directory, if you would like.)
#
# This script should _not_ need to be run using sudo, but
# may use sudo, if necessary, to set up the test environment.
